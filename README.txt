  Mashome - Genome Browser Mashup library
  Matt Rasmussen 2012
  
  This library allows one to visualize *very* custom genome browser
  tracks within a host genome browser web page (e.g. UCSC, Ensembl,
  generic).  Custom tracks are are built and controlled using
  javascript.  Data displayed within tracks can be fetched using AJAX.
